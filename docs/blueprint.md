# **App Name**: GreenCycle

## Core Features:

- AI Waste Classification: Users upload images of waste, and an AI tool detects the waste type (Organic, Recyclable, Hazardous) and provides proper disposal instructions.
- Recycling Center Locator: Interactive map showing the nearest recycling centers and waste collection points using Google Maps integration. Allow government/NGO centers to register their locations.
- Educational Resources: Users can access articles, videos, and quizzes on waste management and sustainability, along with updates on government policies and initiatives.
- Smart Bin Integration: Place QR codes on recycling bins in public areas. Users scan the QR code before throwing waste into the bin. The app registers the disposal event.
- Doorstep Waste Collection: Allow users to schedule a waste pickup with municipal services or waste collection startups.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light grey for a clean, professional look, similar to Evernote.
- Secondary color: Green (#34A853) to represent sustainability and eco-friendliness.
- Accent: Blue (#4285F4) for interactive elements and calls to action.
- Clean, card-based layouts to present information clearly.
- Use a consistent and professional icon set (e.g., Material Design Icons) related to waste management, recycling, and location.
- Subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience.

## Original User Request:
Make a web application and the project is smart waste management system. The application or site name will be Greenbin. Key Features of the web App : Waste Segregation & AI-Based Classification Users upload images of waste. AI detects waste type (Organic, Recyclable, Hazardous). Provides proper disposal instructions. Smart Waste Tracking Users log their waste disposal habits. Dashboard shows waste statistics (how much is recycled, composted, etc.). Encourages users to reduce waste over time. Recycling & Collection Center Locator (Google Maps Integration) Interactive map shows nearest recycling centers & waste collection points. Users can navigate to these centers easily. Government/NGO centers can register their locations. Request Waste Pickup from Local Municipal Services Users can schedule waste pickup from municipal services or waste collection startups. Real-time tracking of waste collectors. Notifications on pickup schedules & collection updates. Community Engagement & Gamification Users earn points for proper waste disposal. Leaderboard for eco-friendly activities (e.g., "Top Recyclers of the Month"). Waste reduction challenges & rewards. Awareness & Education Section Articles, videos, and quizzes on waste management & sustainability. Updates on government policies & initiatives in Mizoram. Tips on composting, recycling, and reducing waste. another feature of this web app will be : ntegration with Smart Bins: Place QR codes or RFID scanners on recycling bins in schools, offices, apartments, and public areas. Users scan the QR code before throwing waste into the bin. The app will register the disposal event and award points only if the QR code is scanned. AI Cross-Checking to Prevent Duplicate Uploads: Use image hashing (a unique identifier for images) to detect duplicate uploads. If a user uploads the same image repeatedly, the system flags it as duplicate, preventing them from earning extra points. Geolocation Tracking for Disposal If the user selects "Disposed in Recycling Center," their GPS location must match a real recycling bin or center. Points are given only if disposal is verified via QR scan + GPS match. ✅ Final Outcome: Stops users from earning fake points by uploading the same image multiple times. Encourages real recycling behavior by requiring a QR scan or GPS verification. and the second one is : Doorstep Waste Collection: If a recycling center is too far, users can schedule a waste pickup. Partner with municipal authorities or local waste collectors for doorstep pickup. Users earn extra points if they request a pickup instead of throwing it away. Recycling Collection Hubs (Micro-Centers): Establish small waste drop-off hubs in every neighborhood or society. These hubs will act as temporary collection points before waste is sent to the main recycling center. Users dropping waste here earn points based on the weight of waste deposited (verified by QR codes). Incentivize Recycling with Vouchers: Instead of just earning virtual points, users get real-life rewards (discounts at local stores, cashback, free bus rides, etc.). This makes them more likely to recycle rather than throw things in garbage bins. ✅ Final Outcome: Convenient disposal through doorstep pickups & local hubs. Real incentives to motivate users to recycle instead of dumping waste.
